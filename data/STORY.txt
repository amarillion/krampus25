You are in the cabin that houses the control room of the nearby gravitational wave sensor. 
This room is full of highly sensitive computer equipment. There is a paper note stuck to one of the monitors.

Ben is the technician on duty. He is manning one of the terminals, typing away at the keyboard.

ANSWER Read note

The note reads: 

<b>ACHTUNG!</b>

<b></b>ZO RELAXEN UND <b>WATSCHEN DER BLINKENLICHTEN</b>.

ANSWER Ask Ben if you can use the computer.

"No way José. This is machine controls the gravitational wave sensor. Any interruption in the data transfer between the sensor and the control systems could cause massive unforeseen consequences. 

He adds: Especially do not touch the <b>time zone settings</b>. I'm serious! This has caused so much trouble in the past!"

NODE START3

You wake up, feeling hung over and rather cold.

ANSWER Look around.
GOTO START4
--------------------------------------------------------------------
NODE START4

You see the inside of a small, sparse bedroom. There is a space heater running at full blast, barely making a dent in the cold.
On the coat rack, there is thick coat, suitable for extremely cold weather.
Your headache clears up a bit. You are slowly starting to remember something...

You are at <a href="https://www.antarctica.gov.au/antarctic-operations/stations-and-field-locations/casey/">Casey Station in Antarctica</a>!

Last night was a christmas party. You are part of a research crew, studying marine biology, climate, and gravitational waves. 
Your specialism is botany, you study lichens, mosses and ferns. Your research has taken you all the way here, to <b>Antarctica</b>.

ANSWER Get dressed and go leave the room.
GOTO COMMON_ROOM
--------------------------------------------------------------------
NODE COMMON_ROOM

The sleeping quarters connect via a hallway to a common room. Several of your colleagues are here,
preparing breakfast, and doing some post-party clean-up.

Your colleague says: "Hurry! Your supervisor is waiting for you outside!"

ANSWER Have some breakfast first.
GOTO BREAKFAST

ANSWER Hurry and go outside.
GOTO CENTER
--------------------------------------------------------------------
NODE BREAKFAST

During breakfast, you listen in on a conversation.

"Do you know who arrived on yesterday's over-snow bus?"

"No?"

"It's, Patrick Pannekoek, the famous <i>Youtube influencer</i> and <i>flat earth conspiracy theorist</i>"

"Oh, a fringe pseudoscientist like that, he can't have many followers, can he?"

"He has many! In fact he has followers from all around the globe!"

You all have a good laugh at that.

ANSWER No more procrastination, go see your supervisor ourside.

GOTO CENTER
--------------------------------------------------------------------

"Had a good party? Let's get to work. I want you to start collecting specimens of moss today."

ANSWER Ask: "Which types of mosses should I look for?"
GOTO INSTRUCTIONS

ANSWER Ask: "What makes these mosses interesting?"
GOTO WHY

ANSWER Leave and get to work.

"See you soon!"

GOTO CENTER
--------------------------------------------------------------------
NODE WHY

Moss is changing rapidly due to climate change. In fact, it is not doing so well with the changing conditions.
We want to understand how we can protect this vulnerable ecosystem.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
NODE SOUTH0

You are on an open plain on the antarctic ice sheet. The famous influencer Patrick Pannekoek is here. He seems rather distressed.
He's standing in front of a beautiful sample of <i>Colobanthus quitensis</i>! 
But he's blocking the safe path, and you don't want to risk stepping into a crevice.

ANSWER Ask: Why are you here?

He tells you that he is here to observe the 24-hour sun for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_Experiment_(expedition)">final experiment</a>. 

GOTO SOUTH
ANSWER Ask him about the final experiment.

The globalist conspiracy will tell you that the Sun is visible for 24 hours in <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/antarctica/casey?month=12&year=2025">December in Antarctica</a>.
This is obviously false, because the earth is flat as a pancake and the south pole is actually an ice wall on the outer rim. I need my compass to confirm I am really on the South Pole.

GOTO SOUTH
IF NOT compass_given
ANSWER Ask: Could you please step aside so I can collect some moss?

First I need to find my compass. I'm sorry, I can't let you distract me from my important mission.

Suddenly, a stranger walks up. You can't quite make out his face. But his voice seems familiar. 
He says: "Were you looking for this?" and hands him a compass.

Patrick accepts with a yelp! "Thank you so much!".

After the consternation has passed, you no longer see the stranger. He disappeared.

SET compass_given
GOTO SOUTH
ENDIF

IF compass_given AND NOT compass_suspected

ANSWER Ask: Why is this compass so important?

With this trusty compass, I can make sure that I'm always heading south. Just to make sure the NASA global conspiracy 
doesn't get a chance to mislead me and place me on the North pole instead. I'm watching the compass needle like a hawk!

SET compass_suspected
GOTO SOUTH
ENDIF
IF compass_suspected
ANSWER Ask: How can you be sure your compass wasn't tampered with?

GOTO SOUTH2
ENDIF
--------------------------------------------------------------------
NODE SOUTH2

Patrick's face turns ashen. You're right, he says. Because I lost sight of my compass, even for a short while, it could have been swapped. 
I can no longer trust it. I can no longer know for certain if I'm really on the South Pole! My mission is a failure!

With a scream of frustration, he runs back to the base, never to be seen again.

SET patrick_left

ANSWER Continue...
GOTO SOUTH3
--------------------------------------------------------------------
NODE SOUTH3

You are on an open plain on the antarctic ice sheet. 

Patrick, the flat earth youtuber, has left.

IF NOT colobanthus

IMAGE Colobanthus_quitensis
SET colobanthus

You pick up a nice sample of <i>Colobanthus quitensis</i>

ENDIF

ANSWER Go back to the central point
GOTO CENTER
--------------------------------------------------------------------
NODE NORTH

You're on the coastline overlooking Newcomb Bay.

IF NOT past

In the distance you see some nice mosses. Unfortunately, the high tide is running up against a steep icy cliff, blocking
the path towards the mossy glade. If only you had gotten up a <b>few hours earlier</b> you would have been able to pick up your moss samples, no problem.

SET bay_visited

ELSE

In the lower tide, you can reach the mosses. Look at that!

IMAGE Schistidium_antarctici
SET schistidium

You collect a sample for your supervisor.

ENDIF

ANSWER Return to the central point.
GOTO CENTER

--------------------------------------------------------------------
NODE WEST

IF compass_given AND ben_visited AND bay_visited
SET ben_away
ENDIF

SET ben_visited

You are in the cabin that houses the control room of the nearby gravitational wave sensor. 
This room is full of highly sensitive computer equipment. There is a paper note stuck to one of the monitors.

IF ben_away
Ben is not here. He must have gone to the bathroom or something
ELSE
Ben is the technician on duty. He is manning one of the terminals, typing away at the keyboard.
ENDIF

ANSWER Read note

The note reads: 

<b>ACHTUNG!</b>

<b></b>ALLES TURISTEN UND NONTEKNISCHEN LOOKENSPEEPERS! DAS KOMPUTERMASCHINE IST NICHT FÜR DER GEFINGERPOKEN UND MITTENGRABEN! ODERWISE IST EASY TO SCHNAPPEN DER SPRINGENWERK, BLOWENFUSEN UND POPPENCORKEN MIT SPITZENSPARKEN. IST NICHT FÜR GEWERKEN BEI DUMMKOPFEN.

<b></b>ZO RELAXEN UND <b>WATSCHEN DER BLINKENLICHTEN</b>.

GOTO WEST
IF ben_away
ANSWER Sit at the vacated computer terminal.
GOTO TERMINAL
ELSE
ANSWER Ask Ben if you can use the computer.

"No way José. This is machine controls the gravitational wave sensor. Any interruption in the data transfer between the sensor and the control systems could cause massive unforeseen consequences. 

He adds: Especially do not touch the <b>time zone settings</b>. I'm serious! This has caused so much trouble in the past!"

GOTO WEST
ANSWER Ask Ben if he's always here.

I'm here all the time. Well, except when I need to go to the bathroom, or when I have to get some coffee and snacks from the common room.

Why do you ask?

GOTO WEST
ENDIF
ANSWER Go back to the central point.
GOTO CENTER
--------------------------------------------------------------------
NODE TERMINAL

You are sitting at the control station. The computer menu gives you a few options. 


ANSWER Check Status

It looks like Ben was running some kind experiment involving magnetic monopoles and microscopic black holes.
Highly technical stuff.

You notice something odd though. The clock showing on the computer is <b>off by three hours</b> compared to the clock on the wall. What's up with that?

ANSWER Run Level Three Diagnostic.

After 10 minute wait, the computer comes up with zero results. Perhaps you need to run a Level Four Diagnostic next time.

ANSWER Check weather

We are currently undergoing a tachyon storm.

ANSWER Update time zone database.

Oh no, what have you done...

GOTO TO_THE_PAST

ANSWER Step away from the computer.

You're right, this is complicated stuff. Better not touch anything before something weird happens...

GOTO WEST
--------------------------------------------------------------------
NODE TO_THE_PAST

In the past, Casey Station <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/antarctica/casey">changed between UTC+8 in the winter season and UTC+11 in the summer</a>, lining up with the time zone in Hobart, Australia.
That was all rather complicated however, and nowadays they just stick to UTC+8 all year around.

The computer was still running on an outdated time zone database, so it was running on UTC+11.

By updating the time zone database on a live data connection, you started a complex chain of events, involving a tachyon storm,
magnetic monopoles and microscopic black holes. The upshot is, that you are catapulted <b>three hours into the past!</b>

ANSWER Continue...
GOTO PAST
--------------------------------------------------------------------
NODE PAST

SET past

You are back at the gravitational control room. Checking the clock on the wall, you see that it is now early morning, three hours earlier than you left.

Many of the researchers are probably still in their bed at this time.
